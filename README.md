# Reinforcement Learning - Daketi

Daketi, or Stealing Bundles, is a customary card game played majorly in South Asia in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. With the main aim of matching cards and making bundles, Daketi tests the computational and probabilistic skill of its players, who attempt to develop the best strategy to eventually have the most points.

Due to the nature of the game, Daketi has high potential of involving computational and probabilistic strategies, combined with aspects of reinforced learning which can create a general "policy" that is effective in many repeating scenarios. This enables us to create an agent which, with semi-RL features, can defeat many skilled players.
